const selectedZone: ZoneSelectionMode =
  ZoneSelectionMode.parse('multiple-stop');
//> Throws error if not multiple-stop is valid.

const selectedZone2: ZoneSelectionMode =
  ZoneSelectionMode.safeParse('multiple-stop');
//> selectedZone2.success = true | false
```

### Usage in YAML validation

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://github.com/atb-as/fare-product-type-configs/schema-definitions/other.json
enableTokenToggleRestrictions: true
tokenToggleMaxLimit: 3
defaultTariffZone: NOR:TariffZone:8040
vatPercent: 12
```

#### Running as CLI

```sh
Usage: npx @atb-as/config-specs -s [schema] -f [file]

Options:
      --version  Show version number                                   [boolean]
  -f, --file     file to validate                                     [required]

## Install

```
yarn add @atb-as/config-specs
```

## Tests and fixtures

Note contract/fixture tests in
[src/tests/contract-fixtures-tests](./src/tests/contract-fixtures-tests). These
tests should never fail unless it is very intentional. These are ment to ensure
backwards compatibility with older apps.

If they fail you need to ensure that the change is intentional and that older
apps refering to the data that is the cause of change is no longer in use.

## Scope and goal of package

Goal of this package is to ensure data quality and consistent data across remote
configuration and usage over time for multiple consumers.

This package should collect specification and validation (incl. types) for data
stored in Firestore. This should ensure easier consistent validation and data
quality across Firestore, Webshop and App for all organisations involved.

1. Collect specifications ("the standard"â„¢)
1. Collect documentation ("how to use the standard")
1. Type generation and Schema validation generation
1. Input validation (Data INTO Firestore)
1. Data decoding / encoding validation. (Data OUT of Firestore)
